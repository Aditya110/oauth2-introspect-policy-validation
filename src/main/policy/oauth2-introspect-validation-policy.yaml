# The Mulesoft out-of-the-box "OAuth 2.0 access token enforcement using external provider policy" expects
# a token validation endpoint and a return map that many OAuth2 servers don't provide in the *undocumented* 
# format expected (RFC 6749 does not define the validation endpoint implementaiton and Mulesoft doesn't
# document how they implement it).
#
# This custom policy is a replacement for that using the RFC 7662 introspect endpoint to
# both validate the Access Token and return the valid scopes and other RFC 7662 response values
# for use downstream in the API implementation. N.B. Whereas the Mulesoft policy only needs the
# Authorization Token in order to validate and introspect it, this policy additionally needs the Client ID and
# Secret, since OpenAM will only respond to an introspect that has been validated with Basic Auth
# using them.
#
# See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-policy-editor and
# https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/creating-a-policy-walkthrough
#
# This policy requires:
#  - header Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
#  - parameters client_id and client_secret
#
# On success, it adds the following headers to the flow based on the keys in the introspection response.
#  X-AGW-scope
#  etc. TBD upon further experimentation.
#
# OpenAM endpoints are documented here:
# https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/openam/13.5/dev-guide#rest-api-oauth2-client-endpoints
#
# The introspect endpoint requires the following:
#  - method POST
#  - header Authorization: Basic <HTTPBasicAuth(client_id,client_secret)>
#  - parameter token=<access_token>
#
# This policy has been tested only with OpenAM 14.0, so might not work with other RFC 7662 implementations.
